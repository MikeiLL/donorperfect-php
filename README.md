# The DonorPerfect PHP Class
A simple class with no dependencies that allows easier PHP access to the DonorPerfect API. This is the missing class I wish DonorPerfect provided out of the box. It's not perfect, but I needed it for a project, so I threw it together in a couple of hours and it's been in a production environment for a year or so now, so has a few fixes and such that make things easier.

Open any issues you find. Enjoy!
